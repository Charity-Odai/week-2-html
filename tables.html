	<h1>NEW TRANSPORT FARES</h1>
	<p>As we all know the transportation fares have gone up by 19% as a result of the rise in fuel prices. The GTPU brought out the new price listing on saturday. </p>
	<p>The price increament is mind blowing and it is likely transport fares may shoot up again by the end of the week. According to some drivers they spend close to Ghc500.00 in a day which is less of the profit they make and they are ready to demonstrate again if correct measures are not put in place.</p>
